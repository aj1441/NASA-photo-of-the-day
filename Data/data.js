      "explanation": "Could this fuzzy blob be the key to the whole\r gamma-ray burst (GRB) mystery?\r Astronomers the world over are now scrambling to determine the\r true nature of the extended emission seen to the lower right of\r the bright source in the above image.\r The bright object in the center is rapidly fading - and thought\r to be the first true optical counterpart to a GRB.\r But is it housed in a galaxy? If\r so, after the central emission has faded, this galaxy should be\r identifiable. Today, follow up observations of this blob are\r planned with the Hubble Space Telescope.\r If the extended emission does come from a galaxy it would bolster\r indications that the February 28th GRB\r occurred in that galaxy, across the universe from us.  This,\r in turn, would imply that GRBs are\r truly the most powerful explosions ever known.\r",

      "explanation": "Outbound and climbing above the plane of our solar system, comet McNaught-Hartley (C/1999 T1) is presently soaring through northern skies. This telescopic picture, a composite of many 30 second exposures made through three color filters, recorded the delicate colors in its diminutive coma and faint tail on February 26th. Combining the exposures to produce the final image registered on the comet causes stars to appear as \"dotted trails\", evidence of the comet's motion relative to the distant stellar background. Discovered by southern hemisphere observers, this comet's closest approach to the Sun occurred in December last year as it passed just outside planet Earth's orbit. For now the brightest comet in the sky, this primordial chunk of solar system is crossing from the constellation Hercules to Draco and will continue to fade. Never visible to the unaided eye, McNaught-Hartley is still at about 10th magnitude and can be viewed by comet seekers using small telescopes.",

      "explanation": "What if you saw your shadow on Mars and it wasn't human? Then you might be the robotic Curiosity rover currently exploring Mars. Curiosity landed in Gale Crater last August and has been busy looking for signs of ancient running water and clues that Mars could once have harbored life. Pictured above, Curiosity has taken a wide panorama that includes its own shadow in the direction opposite the Sun. The image was taken in November from a location dubbed Point Lake, although no water presently exists there. Curiosity has already discovered several indications of dried streambeds on Mars, and is scheduled to continue its exploration by climbing nearby Mt. Sharp over the next few years.",
